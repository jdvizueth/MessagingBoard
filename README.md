In this project, P7, I decided to implement the refreshing functionality to
the message board. This way I am able to update the board whenever I need to
and anytime. I also implemented the GET functionality, allowing to get all the
previous post, the POST functionality, allowing for the ability
to make a new post, including being able to change the a previous message, and
the DELETE functionality, allowing to delete a desired post.
